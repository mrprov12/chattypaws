# PWA (Stage 2+)

Vite + React (TypeScript). Placeholder for Stage 2 (button mapping) and later; Stage 1 is backend-only.

## Run

From this directory:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

App at http://localhost:5173. No need to run from repo root. The dev server proxies `/api` to the backend at http://localhost:8000 when you add API calls later.
