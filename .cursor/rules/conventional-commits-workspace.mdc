# Conventional Commits by Workspace

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) with a **scope** that indicates which part of the repo changed.

## Format

```
type(scope): short description
```

- **type**: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, etc.
- **scope**: One of the workspace scopes below (required).
- **short description**: Lowercase, imperative; no period at the end.

## Workspace scopes

| Scope | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `repo` | Root-only: `docs/`, `.cursor/`, `.gitignore`, root README, root config (e.g. commitlint, husky), anything not under a subrepo. |
| `backend-python` | Any file under `backend-python/`. |
| `pwa` | Any file under `pwa/`. |

**Choosing scope:** Infer from the changed files. If only one workspace is touched, use that scope. If multiple workspaces are touched, prefer one commit per workspace; if you combine, use the primary workspace as scope and mention the other(s) in the body.

## Adding new subrepos

When a new subrepo is added to the monorepo (e.g. a new app or service directory):

1. **Add it as a workspace scope**: Update this rule and the commitlint config with the new scope (e.g. `new-app`).
2. **Document it**: Add a row to the "Workspace scopes" table above and keep the commitlint scope list in sync so commits and tooling stay consistent.
