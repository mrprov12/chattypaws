# Architecture: Scale and Future Needs

When designing or changing architecture (APIs, data models, services, modules), explicitly consider:

## Scaling

- **Load and concurrency**: Will this design handle more users, requests, or background work? Where are the bottlenecks?
- **Data volume**: Will tables, queues, or caches grow; do we need pagination, partitioning, or archiving from the start?
- **Deployment**: Single instance now vs. multiple instances, workers, or regions later — any assumptions that would block horizontal scaling?

## Future features

- **Extensibility**: What’s likely to be added next (e.g. new event types, integrations, tenants)? Does the current shape make those changes local or invasive?
- **Abstraction level**: Are we locking in a detail too early (e.g. one DB, one provider) or over-abstracting for hypotheticals?
- **Coupling**: Can new features plug in without rewriting existing paths? Are boundaries clear (e.g. API vs. domain vs. storage)?

When proposing a design, briefly call out scaling and future-feature implications so we can choose tradeoffs intentionally.
