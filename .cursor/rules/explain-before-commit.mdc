# Explain Before Commit

We already discussed the change before implementing (see Discuss Before Implement). At commit time, keep it brief.

1. **Executive summary only**: In a few sentences, state what the commit contains.
   - What files or areas changed.
   - What it accomplishes (plain terms).
   - Proposed commit message.

2. **Then** wait for approval before staging and committing.

Example: "This commit adds the DB schema and helpers: `backend/db.py` defines the `events` table and `insert_event` / `list_events`; the API creates the table on startup. Plan to commit as: `feat(stage-1): add DB schema and event helpers`."

Do not batch unrelated changes into one commit; prefer one logical step per commit when the work is substantial.
